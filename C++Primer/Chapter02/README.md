## Exercise 2.1:
> What are the differences between int, long, long long,
  and short? Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and
  a double?

<p> &nbsp </p>

> **Answer:** **int** will be at least as large as **short**, a **long** at
least as large as an **int**, and **long long** at least as large as **long**. 
**Unsigned type** holds number greater than or equal to zero while **signed type** holds
positive, negative, and zero numbers. **Floats** are represented in one *word*
while **doubles** are represented in *two words* which provides more precise results than float.
