# Answers to all the exercises
Note: Answers to non-programming exercises will be listed here.

## Exercise 2.1:
> What are the differences between int, long, long long,
  and short? Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and
  a double?

<p> &nbsp </p>

**Answer:**

<br> (1) <br> 

**int** will be at least as large as **short**, a **long** at
least as large as an **int**, and **long long** at least as large as **long**. 

<br> (2) <br> 
**unsigned type** holds number greater than or equal to zero while **signed type** holds
positive, negative, and zero numbers.


<br> (3) <br>
**floats** are represented in one *word* and holds 7 significant digits
while **doubles** are represented in *two words* and holds 10 significant digits which provides more
precise results than float.



## Exercise 2.2: 
> To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use
  for the rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type.

<p> &nbsp </p> 

**Answer:** In calculating the mortgage payment, I would use **double** for all since 
those requires floating-point computations and will provide more precise results than float.
